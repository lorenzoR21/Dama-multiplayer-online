      RABBITMQ_USERNAME=myuser <br>
      RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=mypassword <br>
      RABBITMQ_IP= ... [the IP address of your rabbit container in docker] <br>
      MYSQL_USERNAME=root <br>
      MYSQL_PASSWORD=root <br>
      MYSQL_DB=db <br>
      EMAIL= ... [the email address you want] <br>
      EMAIL_PASSWORD= ... [the password of the email address] <br>
